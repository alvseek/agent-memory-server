"""Schema migrations for the PostgreSQL store.

The Postgres twin of ``schema_migrations.py``: the same discipline — ordered SQL files
under ``migrations_postgres/`` applied through a ``migration_history`` table, each
recorded with a checksum so an applied file can never be silently edited — written
separately rather than shared, because the two runners govern two different stores and
the SQLite runner carries the live store's applied history (see `high-wizard` decision 8).

Two things differ from the SQLite runner, both because Postgres can do what SQLite
cannot:

- **No table-rebuild dance.** Postgres can ``ALTER`` a constraint and add a foreign key
  in place, so ``migrations_postgres/0001_init.sql`` is authored at the final shape and
  there is no equivalent of the SQLite ``0002`` rebuild.
- **Whole-file apply.** psycopg runs a parameterless multi-statement string through the
  simple query protocol, so a migration file is executed in one call and one transaction;
  there is no ``executescript``.

The schema is applied on the repository's first connection, the same contract
``SqliteMemoryRepository`` keeps.
