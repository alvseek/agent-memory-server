"""Schema migrations for the SQLite store.

The schema is defined by the ordered SQL files under ``migrations/`` and applied through a
``migration_history`` table, so a schema change actually reaches a database that already
exists. That is the one thing ``CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`` cannot do, and the whole
reason this module exists: the schema used to be created once and never evolvable, so
every change needed a purge-and-reimport.

No baseline step is needed. ``0001_init`` is written with ``IF NOT EXISTS``, so it is a
no-op on a database that already carries the base schema, and every later migration then
runs exactly once on both a fresh and an existing store.

Each migration runs inside its own transaction and is recorded only on success. An
already-applied migration is checked against its stored checksum, so editing a file that
has already run is refused rather than silently doing nothing.
